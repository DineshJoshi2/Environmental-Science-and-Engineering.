# Removal of organic matter from activated sludge process.
Design Example
The design for the fully aerobic activated sludge system . Assuming constant flow and load conditions, calculations are shown below how estimates of the system volume requirements, average daily carbonaceous oxygen demand, and daily sludge production are calculated for the treatment of the example raw and settled wastewaters.

This design example demonstrates the effect of temperature and sludge age on (i) the mass of TSS sludge in the system (MXt, kgTSS), (ii) the average daily carbonaceous oxygen demand (FOc, kgO2/d), (iii) the active fractions of the sludge with respect to VSS and TSS (fav and fat) and (iv) mass of TSS sludge wasted per day (FXt, kgTSS/d). These five parameters are calculated for the example raw and settled wastewaters at 14 and 22 degree Celsius for sludge ages ranging from 3 to 30 days.
